# -Analyzing-Global-Power-Plant-Database-
In this analysis, I am going to use a power plant dataset. The dataset contain information of verious type of power plant around the world such as thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). The database includes nearly 30,000 power plants from 164 countries.
